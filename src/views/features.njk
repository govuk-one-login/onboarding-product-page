  <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Current features</h1>
  <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK One Login is the new way for central government services to sign in their users.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">It will ultimately allow users to access any government service using the same email address and password.</p>
  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    These features of GOV.UK One Login are now available for services that join private beta. <a class="govuk-link" href="/getting-started">See how to get started.</a>
  </div>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Account creation and sign in</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Users can create an account and sign in to your service with their email address and password.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This means you know it’s always the same person accessing the service.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can let users create their account or sign in at:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the start of your service, if you need them all to have accounts</li>
    <li>the point where they want to save their progress and come back later, if you want to add this option to a complex journey</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Two-factor authentication</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can request that your users use two-factor authentication when they sign in to your service.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Users have two 2FA options:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>getting text messages containing security codes sent to their UK phone number</li>
    <li>using security codes generated by an authenticator app</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Password reset</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Users can reset their password if they forget it.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Journey also available in Welsh</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">At the start of their journey, users can choose to view it in English or Welsh. </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your users create a GOV.UK account</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">In their GOV.UK account, users can do the following things.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">They can see and access their services in one place</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">When a user signs in to your service with their GOV.UK account a link to your service, or to your GOV.UK start page, appears in their account home.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This means they can easily access all the services they’ve used with their GOV.UK account from one place.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Users can continue to access your service through familiar routes, like landing on a GOV.UK start page. </p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">They can manage their account</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">In their account settings, users can change their:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>email address</li>
    <li>password</li>
    <li>phone number</li>

  <p class="govuk-body">They can also delete their account.</p>
