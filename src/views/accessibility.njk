    What this website should do
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This website was created by the Government Digital Service.
    It is designed to be used by as many people as possible.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The text should be clear and simple to understand.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    You should be able to:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>zoom in up to 300% without problems</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    How we tested this website
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The GOV.UK One Login website was last tested on 4 October 2021. The test was carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC), who produced an accessibility audit report on 13 October 2021.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    DAC assessed the GOV.UK One Login website against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Since then we have continued to carry out manual testing against WCAG 2.1.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    What we’re doing to improve accessibility
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Following recommendations from the testing carried out by the DAC in October 2021, we fixed outstanding A and AA issues on the GOV.UK One Login site.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This included:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>making link text more descriptive</li>
    <li>marking fields in our registration form as optional</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

   <p class="govuk-body">
    We are continuing to look at fixing the accessibility issues on the 
    <a href="https://status.account.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK One Login's status page</a> which 
    was added in May 2023. You can <a href="#non-compliances-section" class="govuk-link">

      <li>‘Subscribe to updates’ form fields do not have clear labels (WCAG success criterion 1.3.1)</li>
