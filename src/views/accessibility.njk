    How we tested this website
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The GOV.UK One Login website was last tested in July 2022. The test was carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC), who produced an accessibility audit report on 13 October 2021.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    DAC assessed the GOV.UK One Login website against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The GOV.UK One Login admin tool was last tested in October 2022 by the GOV.UK One Login programme. We carried out automated and manual testing against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 2.1.
  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    What we’re doing to improve accessibility
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Following recommendations from the testing carried out by the DAC in October 2021, we fixed outstanding A and AA issues on the GOV.UK One Login site.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This included:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>making link text more descriptive</li>
    <li>labelling form fields correctly</li>
    <li>fixing some ‘skip’ links that did not take users to the correct destination</li>
  </ul>
  </p>


  <p class="govuk-body">On the GOV.UK One Login admin tool, following our own internal testing, we have fixed outstanding A and AA issues.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">This included:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>making it clear when a user is activating, hovering or focusing over the ‘Show password’ button </li>
    <li>adding a linked error message and error summary to the Redirect URI field on the ‘Change your redirect URIs’ page</li>
  </ul>


  <p class="govuk-body">
    We are continuing to look at fixing the accessibility issues on the 
    <a href="https://status.account.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK One Login's status page</a> which 
    was added in May 2023. You can <a href="#non-compliances-section" class="govuk-link">
